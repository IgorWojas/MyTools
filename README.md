****************** WIP *********************
A simple tool-pack offering mostly some matrix transformations between Eigen and openCV.
It's made to simplify my experiments with Neural Network libraries based on Eigen.
(MiniDNN by Yixuan https://github.com/yixuan/MiniDNN)
OpenCv is used for handling images. 
It also features a timer class for measuring elapsed time and a Monitor class.
The Monitor class helps to organise multiple cv::imshow windows on screen.
There are comments inside which help to understand most functions.
This is still work in progress and will be updated in the future.
Feel free to do whatever you want with it.
Cheers!
